## Problem6: Migrant workers don't have enough employment opportunities in their hometown so starting something from scratch in an easy-to-go market place is like a dream come true.

**Problem Statement** :
After the pandemic things really changed upside down. There were many industries which got affected. The industry which was most affected was the travel industry as there was a ban on traveling due to safety measures. Other who were affected were women of small towns as their source of income was hospitality, selling handicraft in the tourist market, or by their cooking skills. 

**Problem 1**: After the pandemic, the restriction and difficulty in traveling caused the travel industry a major fall back. People associated with the travel industry have less hope in things getting to normal

**Problem 2**: Hotels and catering business is on hold and people primarily women who cook at her homeplace and serve them are hugely impacted due to the pandemic.

**Problem 3**: People from rural parts of India who are in the industry of making ethnic products are in a deep depression because tourism is in hold and selling products to middlemen seems to be a problem in getting appropriate prices.
